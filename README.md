# My-Subscription-code
Solution to coding problem "My Subscription"
We want to build an intelligent system that can calculate the weekly subscription expenses of
essential items for a household. For the sake of this assignment, we will go with the weekly
newspaper subscription. Following table demonstrate prices of some of the prominent
newspapers on a daily basis, all prices in Indian rupees.
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
TOI 3 3 3 3 3 5 6
Hindu 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 4 4
ET 4 4 4 4 4 4 10
BM 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5
HT 2 2 2 2 2 4 4
The input to the program should be the weekly budget/amount that the user has allocated to his
subscriptions. The output must be all possible combinations of the newspaper subscriptions for
the user budget.
Example input/output combination:
Input Output
40 {“TOI”, “BM”}, {“BM”, “HT”}, {“Hindu”, “BM”}, {“Hindu”, “HT”}
35 {“BM”, “HT”}, {“Hindu”, “BM”}
Evaluation Criteria:
● The data structure to hold the details of all newspapers subscription details.
● Efficiency of the logic to calculate the possible combination of subscriptions
● Readable and modular code
